    "In Tensorflow, you collectively call constants, variables, operators as ops. ensorFlow is not justba software library, but a suite of softwares that include TensorFlow, TensorBoard, and TensorServing. To make the most out of TensorFlow, we should know how to use all of the above in conjunction with one another.\n",

    "According to [Google's TensorFlow Team](https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/):\n",
    "> The computations you'll use TensorFlow for - like training a massive deep neural network - can be complex and confusing. To make it easier to understand, debug, and optimize TensorFlow programs, we've included a suite of visualization tools called TensorBoard. You can use TensorBoard to visualize your TensorFlow graph, plot quantitative metrics about the execution of your graph, and show additional data like images that pass through it. When TensorBoard is fully configured, it looks like this:\n",

    "When a user perform certain operations in a TensorBoard-activated TensorFlow program, these operations are exported to an event file. \n",
    "\n",
    "TensorBoard is able to convert these event files to graphs that can give insight into a model's behavior.\n",
